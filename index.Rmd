# Afterthoughts

- Findings are in line with previous work on tongue root .f6[(Kent & Moll 1969; Perkell 1969; Westbury 1983; Ahn 2018; Vazquez-Alvarez & Hewlett 2007)].

--

  - Tongue root movement onset during the articulation of the vowel.
  - Advancement both when following stop is voiced *and* voiceless.

--

- Later closure onset has double advantage:

--

  1. A greater degree of tongue root advancement is achieved at vowel offset/closure onset.
  2. The stop closure is shorter.

--

- Double advantage as a catalyst for sound change.

--

  - Positive feedback loop of productions with later closure onset.

--

- **Mean VT/VD difference: 0.77 mm.** For every **+1 ms** of vowel duration, about **+0.065 mm** advancement of the tongue.

--

  - For an average closure of 70-90 ms, estimated maximum advancement of 4.55 to 5.85 mm.
  - Matches the observed maximum advancement of previous work .f6[(Rothenberg 1967)].

# Afterthoughts

- Findings are compatible with reported presence of preaspiration in Italian .f6[(Nı́ Chasaide & Gobl 1993; Stevens & Hajek 2004a; Stevens & Hajek 2004b; Stevens & Hajek 2010; Stevens 2010; Stevens & Reubold 2014)].

--

  - Increased glottal abduction as precursor of voiceless pre-aspiration .f6[(Berg 1958; Rothenberg 1967; Ohala 2011)].

--

- Emergence of preaspiration.

--

  - Earlier glottal spread first > then shorter closure .f6[(Nı́ Chasaide 1985;  Stevens, Keyser & Kawasaki 2014)].

--

- Prevention of preaspiration.

--

  - Earlier glottal spread first > then earlier closure .f6[(Lisker 1974)]

# Bringing it all together

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
Detailed **articulatory descriptions based on dynamic speech data** can shed light on possible pathways of sound change.

--

.bg-washed-yellow.b--yellow.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
The orchestration of finely coordinated movements contributes to the **pool of variability from which sound change can unfold**.

--

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
Recent technological advancements have opened up new avenues of inquiry about the **role of coarticulation in the unfolding of sound change**.
