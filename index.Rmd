# Coarticulation and sound change

* Coarticulation is a known factor in the development of sound change.

--

* Speech is a complex system of finely coordinated movements that unfold in time.

--

* What can dynamic articulatory data tells us about sound change?

---

# Three case studies

* Tongue root position and timing of oral closure in VC sequences.

* Glottal spread and timing of oral closure in VC sequences.

* Coordination of velum and tongue tip in VNC sequences.
